The federal government's proposal to ban forever from returning to this country anyone who tried to reach Australia by boat without authorisation, even if they have been found to be genuine refugees, is disturbing and bizarre. In this scenario, someone who is found to have been a genuine refugee, that is to have been seeking refuge from war or grave persecution, and who has settled in another country, cannot ever come here, not to live, not as a tourist or on business, and not even decades later. How much more can we compound the punishment of those who had the terrible misfortune to be born in a country racked by war and conflict, or to have suffered persecution? Australia is already the target of international condemnation over its treatment of those seeking asylum here. Mounting evidence gathered by respected non-government organisations of the appalling suffering of adults and children in our offshore detention centres, backed by media exposure, has seen this country roundly criticised. "Australia's inhumane imprisonment of desperate people," a New York Times editorial said last month, "is a disgrace." Of this latest proposal, the United Nations has already said it is "profoundly concerned". Amnesty International has condemned the plan. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said he would never agree to treat refugees as second-class citizens in future by barring them from Australia.
