The human brain has become the premier object of study for fields ranging from psychology 
to machine learning and artificial intelligence. What we know about the brain has 
expanded greatly in the last quarter century, thanks primarily to a specific method of 
scientific inquiry: reductionism. As Nobel Prize-winning scientist Eric Kandel explains, 
this process of breaking apparently whole parts into smaller units gives a real sense of 
the brain's underlying mechanisms. Kandel's personal story of how he made new discoveries 
about the brain parallel his own reductionist method: by breaking down the steps he went 
through, we can better understand how scientific discoveries are made. In this case, they 
were surprisingly haphazard. Indeed Kandel was not schooled in neuroscience at all. He 
was primarily interested in psychoanalysis, and in his senior year of school, was given 
the chance to study the biology of the brain at the National Insitutes of Health.
