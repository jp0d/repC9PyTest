As the ancestors of modern humans made their way out of Africa to other parts of the 
world many thousands of years ago, they met up and in some cases had children with other 
forms of humans, including the Neanderthals and Denisovans. Scientists know this because 
traces of those meetings remain in the human genome. Now, researchers reporting in the 
Cell Press journal Current Biology on November 10 find more evidence that those 
encounters have benefited humans over the years. All told, the new study identifies 126 
different places in the genome where genes inherited from those archaic humans remain at 
unusually high frequency in the genomes of modern humans around the world. We owe our 
long-lost hominid relatives for various traits, and especially those related to our 
immune systems and skin, the evidence shows.
