It sounds like a plot from a comic book or a sci-fi film, a theory that got a boost when 
one of the greatest discoveries in physics in the modern era, the discovery of the “God 
particle,”or the Higgs boson, the missing piece in the Standard Model of particle 
physics. In the preface to his book Starmus, Stephen Hawking warns that the Higgs Boson 
field could collapse, resulting in a chain reaction that would take in the whole universe 
with it. Theoretical physicist Joseph Lykken says it would probably take billions of 
years before we reach that point. Lykken hails from the Fermi National Accelerator 
Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. If it did happen though, you wouldn’t know it. One 
instant you are here, the next, you and everything else is swallowed up by an enormous 
vacuum bubble, traveling at light speed in every direction. Humanity would never see it 
coming.
