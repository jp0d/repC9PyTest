Do you believe in “soul mates”? If so, you should think twice about how that kind of 
romantic attitude towards finding a partner affects your sex life. To have a happy sex 
life in a long term-term relationship requires hard work rather than a “sexpectation” of 
everlasting sexual satisfaction simply because you are “soul mates”, revealed a new study 
by University of Toronto psychologists. The research involved 1900 people and concluded 
that there are essentially two groups of people (even if many are somewhere in between) - 
 those who understand the need for sexual growth and those who believe in “sexual 
destiny”. If you think sex is key, chances are your attitude towards it will either make 
or break the relationship.
