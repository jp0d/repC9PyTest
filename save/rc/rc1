While plane crashes are rare, they are often widely reported; seeing repeatedly graphic images of debris and covered-up bodies simply fills many of us so much fear that we can’t bear the thought of getting on a plane. Take the two recent Malaysian Airlines disasters. Flight 370 vanished somewhere over the Indian Ocean and Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine. Two years on, both cases are still making headlines. Then there was the Germanwings disaster last year, when a suicidal pilot flew a passenger jet into a mountainside in the Alps; not much later the Russian-owned flight Metrojet 9268 was blown up by a suspected bomb shortly after take-off from Egypt. The experts, of course, simply point to the stats: your fear of flying is irrational, because you’re much more likely to die in a car crash than in a plane accident. Indeed, safety statistics by an airline association IATA show that in 2015 more than 3.5 billion people flew on commercial aircraft. During that time, there were 68 accidents, four of which resulted in 136 fatalities. Add in the Germanwings and Metrojet disasters, and the number of deaths is bumped up to 510.
