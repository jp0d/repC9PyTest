Of all physical sensations, ticklishness is perhaps the most mysterious. Why do we laugh in response to tickling? Why are certain body parts more ticklish? Why can we not tickle ourselves? Indeed, the mystery of ticklish perception has been discussed for more than two millennia by great intellectuals including Aristotle and Charles Darwin. Despite such long-standing interest, the mechanism of ticklishness remained elusive.
The new study investigated tickling in rats. Earlier work had shown that young rats respond with 50 kHz ultrasonic "laughter-calls" to tickling by humans. In the novel study rats also reacted enthusiastically to the tickling: they emitted numerous calls. As judged by their calls, rats were most ticklish on the belly and underneath their feet. Rats often performed unsolicited joy jumps after tickling, a behavior that can be seen in joyful subjects in various mammalian species. Rats also played with the researcher's hand and chased it, and emitted similar calls during play.
