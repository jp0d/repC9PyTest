Taking education reform seriously since the 1970s, Finland has climbed the international education ratings by betting on highly competent teachers, the importance of early childhood education, decentralized administration that gives local schools the autonomy to address local needs, and a uniform, free (including meals, transportation and school materials) education for all students. Finnish students score higher than most of their peers on international assessment tests, despite having minimal homework and testing, and a curriculum emphasizing on music, the arts, and outdoor activities. In its latest efforts to keep improving the curriculum and making its pupils more equipped to succeed in the modern world, Finland has rethought the concept of a subject for its basic schools (students aged 7 to 16). With its new National Curriculum Framework 2016 (NCF), Finland emphasizes the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach to education and introduces the concept of “phenomenon-based” teaching, which will result in classes on broader topics such as European Union, Climate Change, Community.
